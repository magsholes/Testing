## The Background

My friend Claire is an avid baker who maintains a steady stream of baking commissions in addition to her more-than-full-time job as a managing editor. She's made countless cakes, pies, cookies, tarts, and other various delectables for practically everyone she knows. Acknowledging the obvious entrepreneurial opportunity at hand, Claire decided she needed to establish a brand that would allow her to find new customers and present what was once a hobby as a legitimate baking business.

## The Assignment

In order to gain trust from potential new clients, Claire needed to present her baking services in a professional manner—with a logo, business cards, website, social media presence, and a variety of other supporting materials.

## The Inspiration

Before building a mood board, we scoured Claire's Instagram likes. Instagram is a major marketing tool for most successful small businesses, including bakers (and it turns out there are some pretty hip bakers out there). Since Instagram displays users' likes in a thumbnail grid, it was particularly easy for us to quickly find patterns in the colors and styles Claire was drawn to. 

Once I had a general feel for her aesthetic direction, I moved on to Pinterest. When looking for inspiration online, I find it best to not necessarily search for exactly what I'm looking for. Sure, it's always useful to look for other up-and-coming baking businesses and how they're branding themselves, but sometimes that inspiration can subconsciously plant itself in my brain and influence the direction—and the end result—too much. Even if that's not the case, looking at what competitors are doing can create unintentional restrictions or "rules." And by that I mean, if I see a lot of bakeries are using badge-style logos, it might seem like the "right way" to make a logo for a bakery is to make it a badge, leading me to only explore badge-style logos for the brand I'm working on.

Basically, all that to say I use Pinterest to creat mood boards by clicking on one image I like, then using the suggested images below that to find the next one, and the next one until I have enough for a mood board—not necessarily by searching for image similar to what I think I want.

Based on the insights from Claire's Instagram likes, I was able to gather inspiration for three different directions:

### Bright, bold, and graphic

### Dark, moody, and earthy

### Classic, delicate, and Parisienne

Each concept included a suggested color story along with the mood images. This ended up being even more helpful than I anticipated, as Claire referred back to these color palettes a lot when discussing which concept she preferred.

## The Concepts

Ultimately Claire chose to go with the second direction: "Dark, moody, and earthy." Now that we had a general idea in mind, I moved forward with logo concepts based on this mood board.

*Final Mood Board Selection*

In a perfect world, a designer could toil away at iteration after iteration of logo design until they find the one solution that works exactly right, and then they'd present this one exquisite logo, and the client would love it, they'd give their immediate approval, and we could all go home and take a nap. 

Unfortunately that's not how things typically work. I've yet to work with a client who would be satisfied with having one logo option presented to them, even if it was the best thing they'd ever seen. People like to choose, as it turns out. In this case, four options felt right, so that's what I presented for Claire to choose from.

### Concept 1

## The Verdict

We don't have one yet! I'll keep this case study updated as the project progresses. I'm eager to see which direction we head and where we end up!
