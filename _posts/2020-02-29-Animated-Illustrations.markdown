For awhile, my office was doing a weekly illustration challenge. I thought this was a great opportunity for me to learn how to draw. It's sort of embarrassing to admit, but although I am a designer by trade, I am not in fact "artistic," and no, having me on your Pictionary team will give you zero advantage, and no, I actually don't know how to "sketch that out real quick." 

So I was excited about this illustration challenge, at least for a couple weeks before we all got busy and it fizzled out. I wanted to work on my motion graphics chops too, so I incorporated some little animations that I thought were fun.

If I do any self-prompted ones in the future, I'll make sure to add them here!
