One of the best things about being a designer is having the ability to make custom gifts for friends and family. To me, it seems more heartfelt and thoughtful (not to mention cheaper) than anything you can buy at a store. A couple years ago, I had the idea to make custom illustrated portraits of my friends' dogs to give to them for Christmas. It was a perfect opportunity to work on my illustration skills, and my friends were overjoyed with the cute portraits of their pets.

Definitely more to come!
