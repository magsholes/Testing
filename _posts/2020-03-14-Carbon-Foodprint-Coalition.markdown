Early this year, one of my close friends approached me with an idea she and another friend had: an organization to educate people about and promote zero-waste food habits. They are both extremely passionate about the environment and wanted to empower others to join them in their mission to help the planet. Thus, Carbon Foodprint Coalition was born. My role in this organization involves branding, design, and generally fulfilling any of their visual communication needs.

### Logo

The first item on our agenda—after deciding what to call ourselves—was to create a logo that communicated our mission a succinctly as possible.

### Brand Guidelines

To aid in the development of a cohesive visual identity, I created a style guide that could be referred to for logo usage, colors, typography, and illustrations.

### Website

<a href="http://foodprintcoalition.org">Carbon Foodprint Coalition's website</a> acts as a hub for all aspects of the organization. Visitors can learn about the environmental impact of their diets, RSVP to a carbon foodprint dinner, download a toolkit that guides them through starting a food scrap ban in their state, and view zero-waste recipes and cooking tips.

### Social

Carbon Foodprint Coalition has an [Instagram account](http://instagram.com/foodprintcoaltion) and a [Facebook page](http://facebook.com/foodprintcoalition) that are updated on a weekly basis or so. As of now, most of our posts are illustrated infographics aimed at educating our followers and driving traffic to the website. The Facebook page also acts as a hub for our dinner events.
