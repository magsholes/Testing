<a href="http://pepsicopartners.com/">PepsiCo Partners</a> is the go-to place for PepsiCo Foodservice customers to easily order products, submit equipment service requests, and stay up-to-date with the latest beverage trends. For 2020, PepsiCo Partners needed a content plan and cohesive style guide to establish a consistent look and feel across multiple communication channels.

### Style Guide

Before our team could create any content, we needed a style guide to serve as the foundation. I developed these guidelines that included type treatment, iconography, colors, and more. This document proved instrumental in keeping all communications cohesive and on-brand.

### Email

Every month, PepsiCo Partners customers receive emails that features new products, recent articles, and helpful website features. It was vital to make this newsletter as engaging and easy to read as possible for operators, but we also needed to build a flexible template system that was simple enough for anyone to edit while sticking to the established style guide.

### Site Content

The PepsiCo Partners website is home to a variety of useful articles targeted toward foodservice operators. I collaborated with our team's copywriter and created compelling imagery—infographics, illustrations, and icons—to accompany these articles. The website also features different sub-brands on the homepage that I regularly created banners for.
