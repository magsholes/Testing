Gas station food is one of life's guiltiest pleasures—who doesn't love a hot taquito fresh off the roller grill? Some convenience stores have taken it to the next level, though, and go so far as to have their own commercial kitchens serving fresh food for customers, essentially operating as a small quick service restuarant. But many of Sunoco's operations were missing out on this profitable opportunity simply due to a lack of space. To provide an innovative and on-trend solution to these operators, Sunoco tested out a food truck concept called Runaway Grub that could be stationed outside these gas stations.

### The Concept

Runaway Grub's menu offers indulgent twists on classic culinary staples: a chicken sandwich, but with a donut for a bun; a breakfast sandwich served on a waffle instead of a biscuit; burritos filled with Flamin' Hot Cheetos. The food truck's design needed to communicate the unique nature of its food at first glance.

Even though this concept wasn't the final direction chosen by the client, it was my favorite one of the bunch—and that's just how it goes sometimes.
