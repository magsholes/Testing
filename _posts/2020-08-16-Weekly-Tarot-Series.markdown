Every week, I draw a tarot card and then...draw that tarot card.

#### Week of 9/14/20

### The Nine of Wands

As a suit, wands are connected to the element of fire and often represent courage, passion, or drive. The number nine could symbolize a journey or project nearing its completion. Put those together, and this card encourages us to persevere and find that last little bit of strength to see something through to the end.

### The Four of Pentacles

Pentacles, or coins, symbolize the material world in the literal sense—our money and possessions—but also in a slightly more abstract way—our careers and talents. The protective nature of the figure in this card represents control over these things in our lives. It could mean now is a good time to save money or make safe career decisions in order to maintain that control.

### The Two of Cups

The two of cups signifies the beginning of a strong mutual connection. That could represent a budding romance, a new business partnership, or a potential friendship. This is a good reminder to celebrate such relationships and show those you love how grateful you are to have them in your life.
