Every week, I draw a tarot card and then...draw that tarot card.

### The Nine of Wands

As a suit, wands are connected to the element of fire and often represent courage, passion, or drive. The number nine could symbolize a journey or project nearing its completion. Put those together, and this card encourages us to persevere and find that last little bit of strength to see something through to the end.
