This is a series in which I draw a tarot card and then...draw that tarot card. There isn't necessarily a certain style I stick to. This is more about trying out different things and seeing what I like. Enjoy!

#### Week 1

### The Nine of Wands

As a suit, wands are connected to the element of fire and often represent courage, passion, or drive. The number nine could symbolize a journey or project nearing its completion. Put those together, and this card encourages us to persevere and find that last little bit of strength to see something through to the end.

#### Week 2

### The Four of Pentacles

Pentacles, or coins, symbolize the material world in the literal sense—our money and possessions—but also in a slightly more abstract way—our careers and talents. The protective nature of the figure in this card represents control over these things in our lives. It could mean now is a good time to save money or make safe career decisions in order to maintain that control.

#### Week 3

### The Two of Cups

The two of cups signifies the beginning of a strong mutual connection. That could represent a budding romance, a new business partnership, or a potential friendship. This is a good reminder to celebrate such relationships and show those you love how grateful you are to have them in your life.

#### Week 4

### The Two of Swords

Swords are the suit of logic and intellect. The figure on this card must make a decision, however she doesn't necessarily have the clarity or insight to see the whole picture yet. The two of swords may suggest that logic won't help you make every decision; sometimes you have to trust your instincts.

#### Week 5

### The Moon

Finally, we're dipping into the Major Arcana! These cards can often seem to hold more significance than the suited Minor Arcana cards in that they reflect some larger aspect of our lives. In this case, The Moon is symbolic of our subconsious or our intuition. It marks the beginning of a sort of awakening, one that may seem frightening or worrisome because of how unknown the future is to us. There's certainly a lot going on in this card, and it can be interpreted many ways. To me, it's a reminder that although the universe is massive and daunting, we're built to navigate it.
