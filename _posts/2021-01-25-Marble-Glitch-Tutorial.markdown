One of my favorite things to do in Procreate is is make these insane-looking glitchy marble patterns. If you follow me on Instagram, you've probably seen a few. It's a surprisingly therapeutic process. There are endless possibilities and this process never yields the same results, which I love. You have tons of options and total control over the final result!

Someone asked me recently how to make them, so here we go!

### 1. Create Your Canvas

You can really use any size or shape canvas for this. I like to do a 1080x1080px square because it's a good size to share on Instagram. 1080x1920 is also a good size if you want to share it on your story or use as a phone background. If you plan on printing this piece, just make sure your DPI is set to 300.

### 2. Choose Your Colors

Choose 3-6 different colors you'd like to use. I try to vary the brightness of them so I have plenty of contrast in the final piece. We can tweak the colors quite a lot at the end, so don't spend too much time trying to get the perfect color scheme. Here's mine:

### 3. Time to Paint

I like to use a soft airbrush to paint the colors. You can use a harder-edged brush if you'd like, but I prefer the way the colors blend together with a soft brush. 


Hide the layer with your reference colors (or delete it if you've created a new palette and saved them there) and create a new layer for each color. You can just use one layer, but sometimes it's nice to be able to change the order and play around with it a bit first. Here's what my layers look like:

<img class="double" src="../../../../assets/images/glitch/glitch-tut-3.jpg" alt="Layer 1" />
<img class="double" src="../../../../assets/images/glitch/glitch-tut-4.jpg" alt="Layer 2" />
<img class="double" src="../../../../assets/images/glitch/glitch-tut-5.jpg" alt="Layer 3" />
<img class="double" src="../../../../assets/images/glitch/glitch-tut-6.jpg" alt="Layer 4" />

Nothing too precise yet, just getting colors down and distributed in an interesting way.

Once you're happy with your paint job, group your layers, duplicate the group, and flatten the new group into one final layer that we'll now edit going forward. You can hide your original grouped layers. This way you'll have your original layers intact in case you want to go back and do something different. 

Or you're welcome to just flatten your original layers into one. Either way works!

### 4. Experiment!

Now we have some fun. Procreate has a bunch of adjustment options built in, and I've highlighted with a star the ones that I like to use. I would encourage you to play around with all of these and see what you like, skip the ones you don't like, and even try some different ones. Applying the adjustments in different orders will give you completely different results. Here's the order I usually go in:

- Liquify
- Chromatic Abberation
- Bloom
- Halftone
- Glitch
- Color Balance

Liquify and Glitch are the only two that you really have to use to get the glitchy-marbled effect, but layering all these other ones will add even more character to your piece. Let's go through each adjustment and see what they do.

#### Liquify

<img class="double float-left" src="../../../../assets/images/glitch/glitch-tut-8.jpg" alt="Liquify" />

If you've ever used the Liquify tool in Photoshop, you'll be a pro at this. It works basically exactly the same in Procreate. Your layer essentially becomes "liquified" and you can push and pull parts of your image to make it look warped. You can tap on the option that says "Push" and choose from a variety of different ways to warp the image. To achieve a marbled paint effect, I usually stick to "Push" with the settings pictured. For different results, try playing with the sliders to change the size of the brush, how distorted it looks, and how fast it moves. 

#### Chromatic Abberation

This adjustment is probably my favorite. In photography, "chromatic abberation" is a mistake where the lens doesn't line up the different colors in the image quite right. It causes a weird colored aura on the edges of the subject that almost look like an image you'd view with 3D glasses.

Honestly, I don't know why this "mistake" is a feature built into Procreate, but I'm glad it is. We can add a lot of depth and "trippy-ness" to our image with this adjustment. There are two main options: Perspective and Displace. 

<img class="double" src="../../../../assets/images/glitch/glitch-tut-9.jpg" alt="Chromatic Abberation - Perspective" />
<img class="double" src="../../../../assets/images/glitch/glitch-tut-10.jpg" alt="Chromatic Abberation - Displace" />

Displace gives you more control over the placement, blurriness, and transparency of the effect and can make it a lot more intense. Perspective can be more subtle and gradually amplifies the effect the further it gets from the focal point. Usually I use Displace, but I went with Perspective for this one because I wanted it to be less extreme.

#### Bloom

<img class="double float-left" src="../../../../assets/images/glitch/glitch-tut-11.jpg" alt="Bloom" />

Again, I'm pretty certain this adjustment is based on a photography mistake. It will "blow out" your highlights and create a kind of over-exposed appearance. It's a good way to add more contrast to your piece if your colors aren't popping.

To increase or decrease the intensity, drag your pencil from left to right across your canvas. The adjustment amount will display at the top of the screen.

#### Halftone

<img class="double float-left" src="../../../../assets/images/glitch/glitch-tut-12.jpg" alt="Halftone" />

This adjustment makes the image look like it was printed. Similar to adding noise, it gives the piece some nice texture. I prefer using Halftone to Noise because the grain is more aligned and less random. It's a really subtle effect but it can make a huge difference in your final result. You can choose from three options: Full Color, Screen Print, and Newspaper. 

One thing to note about using this (or Noise) is that you want to do it after all your other effects besides Glitch and Color Balance. If you do it earlier in the process, the grain will be affected as well and it will look strange.


#### Glitch 

There are tons of possibilities with this adjustment, so you can really go crazy here. You have four different types of glitch effect that you can use: Artifact, Wave, Signal, Diverge. 

<img class="double" src="../../../../assets/images/glitch/glitch-tut-13.jpg" alt="Glitch - Artifact" />
<img class="double" src="../../../../assets/images/glitch/glitch-tut-14.jpg" alt="Glitch - Wave" />
<img class="double" src="../../../../assets/images/glitch/glitch-tut-15.jpg" alt="Glitch - Signal" />
<img class="double" src="../../../../assets/images/glitch/glitch-tut-16.jpg" alt="Glitch - Diverge" />

I don't have one recommendation here because I think I've used all of these at varying intensities. They're all great!

#### Color Balance

Whew! Did you make it this far? This is always the very last adjustment I do to tweak the colors. You have total control over the hue of the highlights, midtones, and shadows. Here's a before and after of mine with Color Balance added:

<img class="double" src="../../../../assets/images/glitch/glitch-tut-17.jpg" alt="Before Color Balance" />
<img class="double" src="../../../../assets/images/glitch/glitch-tut-18.jpg" alt="After Color Balance" />

### 5. Export

Here's my final result:

<img class="single no-border" src="../../../../assets/images/glitch/Marble-Glitch-Final.png" alt="Final Result" />

You can now export this as a PNG or JPG and share or print!
