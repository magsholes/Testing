### Hi, I'm Maggie.

I'm a designer, art director, and occasionally a copywriter with about five years of experience under my belt. Currently, I live in Kansas City and work remotely for an ad agency specializing in foodservice. On a typical day, I get to design print and digital ads, develop brand guidelines, create social media content, build wireframes, or think up countless concepts.  For fun, I like to watch scary movies, play silly video games, do yoga, and sometimes I get the crazy idea that I want to build a website from scratch (like this one).

I'm always looking for new and exciting things to make, so if you have a project you'd like to collaborate on, email me anytime at <a href="mailto:magsholes@gmail.com" target="_blank">magsholes@gmail.com</a>.
